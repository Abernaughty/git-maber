## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Frontend Framework**: SvelteKit was chosen over React or Vue.js because:
   - It builds on the existing codebase (if Svelte is already in use)
   - It offers excellent performance with minimal JavaScript
   - It provides built-in server-side rendering for SEO benefits
   - It has a simpler learning curve and development experience

2. **Backend Approach**: Express.js was selected because:
   - It's lightweight and flexible
   - It has excellent TypeScript support
   - It integrates well with Azure services
   - It's widely adopted with good community support

3. **Database Selection**: Azure Cosmos DB was chosen because:
   - It offers flexible schema for varied content types
   - It provides global distribution capabilities
   - It integrates directly with other Azure services
   - It supports multiple APIs (SQL, MongoDB, etc.)

### Design Considerations
1. **UI/UX Approach**:
   - Professional yet personal design aesthetic
   - Focus on showcasing projects and skills
   - Clear information hierarchy
   - Responsive design for all devices
   - Accessibility as a priority

2. **Content Strategy**:
   - Project-centric approach
   - Technical blog for knowledge sharing
   - Clear skills and expertise presentation
   - Easy contact and connection options

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Server-side rendering for initial load
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Image optimization
   - Caching strategy
   - CDN integration

2. **Security Implementation**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Azure Key Vault for secrets
   - Regular dependency updates

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
1. **Component Structure**:
   - One component per file
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Logical grouping in directories
   - Index files for exports

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for components
   - camelCase for variables and functions
   - kebab-case for files and directories
   - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

3. **File Organization**:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
   │   ├── common/       # Shared components
   │   ├── layout/       # Layout components
   │   └── [feature]/    # Feature-specific components
   ├── routes/           # SvelteKit routes
   ├── lib/              # Shared utilities and helpers
   │   ├── api/          # API client functions
   │   ├── stores/       # Svelte stores
   │   └── utils/        # Utility functions
   └── static/           # Static assets
   ```

### Coding Patterns
1. **Component Composition**:
   - Small, focused components
   - Composition over inheritance
   - Props for configuration
   - Events for communication

2. **State Management**:
   - Svelte stores for global state
   - Component state for local concerns
   - Derived stores for computed values
   - Context API for deep component trees

3. **API Interaction**:
   - Centralized API client
   - Typed responses with TypeScript
   - Error handling middleware
   - Loading state management

### Styling Approach
1. **TailwindCSS Usage**:
   - Utility-first approach
   - Component extraction for repeated patterns
   - Custom theme configuration
   - Responsive design with breakpoints

2. **Design System**:
   - Design tokens in TypeScript for consistency
   - CSS variables for theming
   - Component variants and sizes
   - Accessibility-first approach
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## Learnings and Project Insights

We've gained several insights during the implementation phase:

1. **Component Library Development**: Building a component library requires careful planning of the component API, variants, and props. It's important to strike a balance between flexibility and simplicity.

2. **Accessibility Considerations**: Accessibility should be built into components from the start. Issues like proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support need to be addressed early.

3. **TypeScript Integration**: TypeScript provides excellent type safety but requires careful planning of interfaces and types. It's worth the initial investment for the long-term benefits of code quality and developer experience.

4. **Design Token System**: A well-structured design token system provides a single source of truth for design values and ensures consistency across the application. It also makes theme customization much easier.

5. **Testing Component Libraries**: Testing UI components requires a combination of unit tests for logic and visual tests for appearance. The Testing Library approach of testing from a user's perspective is valuable.

1. **TypeScript Configuration Challenges**: Setting up TypeScript with Express.js requires careful configuration, especially for route handlers and middleware. We need to ensure proper typing for request and response objects.

2. **Backend Structure Importance**: A well-organized backend structure with clear separation of concerns (routes, controllers, middleware, services) makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend.

3. **Authentication Complexity**: Implementing JWT authentication requires careful consideration of token management, security, and user experience. We need to balance security with usability.

4. **Balance of Static and Dynamic**: While adding dynamic capabilities, we need to maintain the performance benefits of static content where appropriate. Not all content needs to be dynamic.

5. **Azure Integration Strategy**: Rather than forcing Azure services into the project, we should identify natural integration points that showcase real-world usage.

6. **Progressive Enhancement**: We should build the enhanced portfolio in layers, ensuring each stage is functional before adding more complexity.

7. **Content First**: Despite the technical focus, the content (projects, skills, blog posts) should drive the design and implementation decisions.

8. **Documentation Importance**: As this project itself is a showcase of skills, thorough documentation of both the code and the architectural decisions is crucial.
