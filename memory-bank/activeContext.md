5. **Favicon Fix** (11:24 AM):
   - Fixed production favicon issue where `/favicon.png` was returning 404
   - Updated `app.html` to use `/images/mabear-icon.png` instead, which was already working in production
   - Verified the fix works in both development and production environments
   - Root cause: Azure Static Web Apps wasn't serving files from the build root correctly

6. **Resume Section Added** (11:50 AM):
   - Added a fourth contact method card in the Get In Touch section for Resume

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
1. âœ… **Update portfolio content for job search** - Successfully completed all content updates

2. **Deploy updated portfolio** - Push changes to production environment

3. **Consider additional enhancements**:
   - Add metrics/achievements section
   - Include certifications if applicable
   - Add testimonials or recommendations
   - Create a downloadable resume link

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)
1. **Monitor and iterate** based on feedback from job applications
2. **Add new projects** as they are completed
3. **Keep skills section current** with new technologies learned
4. **Optimize SEO** for better discoverability

### Medium-term Goals (2-4 weeks)
1. **Implement backend API** to replace mock data
2. **Add blog functionality** to demonstrate thought leadership
3. **Create case studies** for key projects
4. **Implement analytics** to track portfolio engagement

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Content Strategy
1. **Professional Positioning**: The portfolio now positions the developer as an experienced professional with specific expertise in cloud solutions and full-stack development, rather than someone just starting out.

2. **Skills Presentation**: The expanded four-category skills section better represents the breadth and depth of technical capabilities, making it easier for recruiters and hiring managers to quickly assess qualifications.

3. **Project Descriptions**: Each project description now tells a story of technical achievement and problem-solving, rather than just listing what was built.

### Technical Considerations
1. **Mock Data Structure**: The current implementation uses mock data in the API client, which makes it easy to update content without a backend. This is sufficient for the immediate job search needs.

2. **Component Architecture**: The existing component structure (ProjectCard, stores, API client) provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.

3. **Performance**: The portfolio loads quickly and performs well, which is important for making a good first impression.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Content Writing Patterns
1. **Professional Language**: Use confident, professional language that demonstrates expertise
2. **Specific Technologies**: Always mention specific technologies and frameworks
3. **Quantifiable Achievements**: Include metrics where possible (e.g., "167x performance optimization")
4. **Problem-Solution Format**: Frame projects in terms of problems solved

### Portfolio Best Practices
1. **Above the Fold**: Most important information (name, title, CTA) visible immediately
2. **Clear Navigation**: Easy access to all sections
3. **Project Showcase**: Detailed descriptions with live links and source code
4. **Skills Organization**: Logical grouping that matches job requirements
5. **Contact Information**: Multiple ways to connect

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Portfolio Optimization Insights
1. **First Impressions Matter**: The hero section tagline is crucial for setting professional tone
2. **Confidence is Key**: Removing "aspiring" language significantly improves professional perception
3. **Comprehensive Skills**: Recruiters scan skills sections quickly - comprehensive listings help with keyword matching
4. **Project Depth**: Detailed project descriptions demonstrate real experience and problem-solving ability

### Technical Implementation Insights
1. **Incremental Updates**: Making focused updates to specific sections is more manageable than complete overhauls
2. **Mock Data Benefits**: Using mock data during development allows for rapid iteration on content
3. **Component Reusability**: The existing ProjectCard component handled enhanced descriptions well
4. **Responsive Grid**: The skills grid layout adapts well to four categories

### Job Market Considerations
1. **Cloud Skills are Valuable**: Emphasizing Azure and cloud architecture aligns with market demand
2. **Full-Stack is Preferred**: Showing both frontend and backend expertise opens more opportunities
3. **Modern Practices Matter**: Including TDD, accessibility, and CI/CD demonstrates professional maturity
4. **Specific Technologies**: Listing specific tools and frameworks helps with ATS (Applicant Tracking System) matching
