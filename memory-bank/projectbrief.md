# Project Brief

## Overview
This document defines the core requirements and goals for the Portfolio Enhancement Project. It serves as the foundation document that shapes all other files in the Memory Bank.

## Project Name
Portfolio Enhancement Project

## Project Description
The Portfolio Enhancement Project aims to transform an existing static portfolio website into a comprehensive, dynamic showcase of the developer's skills, projects, and expertise in Azure technologies.
