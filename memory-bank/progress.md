## Known Issues

As we progress through the foundation phase, we've identified several implementation-specific issues:

1. **Button Gradient Consistency Issues**:
   - Challenge: Buttons had inconsistent gradients that needed to be standardized
   - Symptoms: "View My Work" button had blue-to-purple gradient, "Get In Touch" button had blue-to-lighter-blue gradient
   - Goal: Make both buttons have the same gradient for visual consistency
   - Mitigation: Applied the primary-gradient class and inline styles with !important to both buttons
   - Status: ✅ Resolved - Both buttons now have the same blue-to-purple gradient
   - Update (4/10/2025): Standardized on the blue-to-purple gradient for both buttons to match the gradient text effect used in headings

1. **Accessibility Issues in Components**:
   - Challenge: Ensuring proper accessibility for interactive components
   - Symptoms: ESLint warnings about missing ARIA roles and keyboard navigation
   - Mitigation: Refactor components to use proper semantic elements and ARIA attributes
   - Status: ✅ Resolved by updating the Card component to use a button element when interactive

1. **TypeScript Configuration Issues**:
   - Challenge: String literals with apostrophes causing TypeScript errors
   - Symptoms: TypeScript compiler errors in string literals
   - Mitigation: Replace problematic apostrophes in string literals
   - Status: ✅ Resolved by fixing string literals throughout the codebase

2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Challenges**:
   - Challenge: Browser-specific APIs like localStorage not available during SSR
   - Symptoms: "localStorage is not defined" errors during server-side rendering
   - Mitigation: Add browser environment detection and conditionally execute browser-only code
   - Status: ✅ Resolved by adding browser detection with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks

3. **This Reference Issues**:
   - Challenge: 'this' reference issues in the auth store
   - Symptoms: Undefined 'this' errors when accessing store methods
   - Mitigation: Refactor code to avoid 'this' binding issues
   - Status: ✅ Resolved by fixing 'this' references in the auth store

4. **Image Path Resolution**:
   - Challenge: 404 errors when loading project images
   - Symptoms: Images not displaying in the project cards
   - Mitigation: Fix image paths and ensure correct static file serving
   - Status: ✅ Resolved by adding images to the correct directory and updating paths

5. **Untracked Files**:
   - Challenge: TailwindCSS-related files added but not yet committed to the repository
   - Symptoms: TailwindCSS working in local development but would be missing in deployment
   - Mitigation: Commit the untracked files to the repository
   - Status: ✅ Resolved by committing TailwindCSS configuration files and components

6. **Future Backend Integration**:
   - Challenge: Designing API client to work with both mock data and future real backend
   - Mitigation: Create flexible API interfaces that can be easily switched
   - Status: In progress - API client structure implemented with mock data

7. **Development Complexity**:
   - Challenge: Managing frontend architecture improvements efficiently
   - Mitigation: Clear separation of concerns, modular architecture, comprehensive documentation
   - Status: Ongoing - architecture improvements implemented in portfolio-updates branch

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Concept
The project began as an idea to enhance an existing static portfolio website to better showcase Azure expertise and full-stack development skills. The initial concept focused on:

- Adding dynamic content management
- Integrating Azure services
- Implementing a blog platform
- Creating an admin dashboard

### Branch Strategy Evolution
We've evolved our approach to include a dedicated branch for enhancements:

1. **Initial Approach**: Work directly on main branch
   - Pros: Simpler workflow, immediate visibility of changes
   - Cons: Risk of breaking existing functionality, harder to track changes

2. **Revised Approach**: Create portfolio-updates branch
   - Pros: Isolated environment for enhancements, easier to track changes
   - Cons: Need to manage branch synchronization
   - Rationale: Safer development approach, better organization of changes

### Architecture Evolution
After evaluating the requirements and existing codebase, we decided on:

1. **Frontend Framework**:
   - Initial consideration: React, Vue.js, or SvelteKit
   - Decision: SvelteKit for its performance, simplicity, and SSR capabilities
   - Rationale: Better performance with less JavaScript, simpler state management, and built-in SSR for SEO

2. **Backend Approach**:
   - Initial consideration: NestJS, Express.js, or Fastify
   - Decision: Express.js for its flexibility and widespread adoption
   - Rationale: Lightweight, flexible, excellent TypeScript support, and good Azure integration

3. **Database Selection**:
   - Initial consideration: Azure SQL, MongoDB, or Cosmos DB
   - Decision: Azure Cosmos DB for its flexibility and Azure integration
   - Rationale: Schema flexibility for varied content, global distribution, and direct Azure service integration

### Implementation Strategy Evolution
The implementation strategy evolved from a complete rewrite to a progressive enhancement approach:

1. **Initial Approach**: Complete rebuild with new technologies
   - Pros: Clean slate, modern architecture
   - Cons: Time-consuming, risk of losing existing functionality

2. **Revised Approach**: Progressive enhancement
   - Start with existing codebase
   - Gradually introduce new technologies and features
   - Maintain functionality throughout the process
   - Rationale: Faster time to initial value, reduced risk, iterative improvements

### Feature Prioritization Evolution
Feature priorities evolved based on the core objectives of showcasing Azure expertise and full-stack development skills:

1. **Initial Priority**: Visual design and UI enhancements
2. **Revised Priority**: Functional demonstrations of Azure services and backend capabilities
3. **Rationale**: Better alignment with the goal of showcasing technical skills rather than just design abilities
