# Progress: Fluid Simulation Cursor Effect

## Current Status
Testing phase complete - Optimal configuration values determined, implementation ready for deployment.

## Completed Tasks
- Analyzed reference implementation of SplashCursor component
- Created project plan and file structure
- Identified key components and algorithms
- Determined configuration parameters
- Created memory bank documentation
- Set up basic project structure with HTML and CSS
- Implemented WebGL initialization
- Created shader programs for fluid simulation
- Implemented fluid simulation core logic
- Added event handling for mouse and touch interactions
- Created UI controls for adjusting simulation parameters
- Tested and optimized configuration values for optimal visual effect
- Discovered optimal parameter settings for fluid dissipation and movement

## In Progress
- Browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device optimization

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing on different devices and browsers
2. Finalize performance optimization for mobile devices
3. Consider adding additional visual effects or features
4. Create documentation for users

## Known Issues
- May have performance issues on lower-end devices
- WebGL support varies across browsers
- Touch events may need further refinement on mobile devices

## Optimal Configuration
```javascript
const config = {
    SIM_RESOLUTION: 128,
    DYE_RESOLUTION: 1440,
    DENSITY_DISSIPATION: 3.5,  // Higher values make the fluid fade faster
    VELOCITY_DISSIPATION: 2,   // Higher values reduce motion persistence
    PRESSURE: 1,
    PRESSURE_ITERATIONS: 20,
    CURL: 3,                   // Lower values create less swirling
    SPLAT_RADIUS: 0.2,         // Controls the size of fluid splats
    SPLAT_FORCE: 6e3,          // Controls the energy of fluid movement
    SHADING: true,
    COLOR_UPDATE_SPEED: 10,
    BACK_COLOR: { r: 0.5, g: 0, b: 0 }, // Dark red background
    TRANSPARENT: true
};
```

## Notes
- Successfully adapted the React component to a vanilla JavaScript implementation
- Configuration parameters can be adjusted through the UI
- The implementation follows the same approach as the reference but with a more modular structure
- Discovered that dissipation parameters behave counter-intuitively - values above 1 increase dissipation rate
- Found a good balance between visual appeal and performance with the current configuration
