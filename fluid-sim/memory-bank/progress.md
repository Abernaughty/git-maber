# Progress: Fluid Simulation Cursor Effect

## Current Status
Implementation complete - Optimal configuration values determined, UI issues fixed, and project deployed to Azure Static Web App.

## Completed Tasks
- Analyzed reference implementation of SplashCursor component
- Created project plan and file structure
- Identified key components and algorithms
- Determined configuration parameters
- Created memory bank documentation
- Set up basic project structure with HTML and CSS
- Implemented WebGL initialization
- Created shader programs for fluid simulation
- Implemented fluid simulation core logic
- Added event handling for mouse and touch interactions
- Created UI controls for adjusting simulation parameters
- Tested and optimized configuration values for optimal visual effect
- Discovered optimal parameter settings for fluid dissipation and movement
- Removed test splat code that was causing a flash in the center of the screen on page load
- Added maber.io logo to the center of the background, behind the fluid effect
- Created a separate Git branch (reflective-logo) for future work on implementing a reflective effect

## In Progress
- Browser compatibility testing
- Mobile device optimization

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing on different devices and browsers
2. Finalize performance optimization for mobile devices
3. Consider adding additional visual effects or features
4. Create documentation for users
5. Monitor Azure Static Web App deployment for any issues
6. Implement reflective effect between the logo and fluid (in the reflective-logo branch)

## Deployment Configuration
- Added `staticwebapp.config.json` for Azure Static Web App deployment
- Configured proper MIME types for shader files
- Set up security headers and routing rules
- Documented Azure deployment settings in activeContext.md
- Successfully deployed to Azure Static Web App with GitHub Actions workflow
- Automatic deployment triggered on push to main branch

## Known Issues
- May have performance issues on lower-end devices
- WebGL support varies across browsers
- Touch events may need further refinement on mobile devices

## Optimal Configuration
```javascript
const config = {
    SIM_RESOLUTION: 128,
    DYE_RESOLUTION: 1440,
    DENSITY_DISSIPATION: 3.5,  // Higher values make the fluid fade faster
    VELOCITY_DISSIPATION: 2,   // Higher values reduce motion persistence
    PRESSURE: 1,
    PRESSURE_ITERATIONS: 20,
    CURL: 3,                   // Lower values create less swirling
    SPLAT_RADIUS: 0.2,         // Controls the size of fluid splats
    SPLAT_FORCE: 6e3,          // Controls the energy of fluid movement
    SHADING: true,
    COLOR_UPDATE_SPEED: 10,
    BACK_COLOR: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0 }, // Deep black background
    TRANSPARENT: true
};
```

## Notes
- Successfully adapted the React component to a vanilla JavaScript implementation
- Configuration parameters can be adjusted through the UI
- The implementation follows the same approach as the reference but with a more modular structure
- Discovered that dissipation parameters behave counter-intuitively - values above 1 increase dissipation rate
- Found a good balance between visual appeal and performance with the current configuration
