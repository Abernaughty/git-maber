# Project Brief: Fluid Simulation Cursor Effect

## Project Overview
Create a WebGL-based fluid simulation that follows cursor movements, creating a colorful "smoke" trail effect.

## Project Directory
C:/Users/maber/Documents/GitHub/git-maber/fluid-sim/

## Core Requirements
1. Implement a fluid simulation using WebGL and shader programs
2. Create a colorful trail that follows cursor movements
3. Support both mouse and touch interactions
4. Ensure smooth performance across different devices
5. Display the maber.io logo in the center of the background
6. Ensure the fluid effect flows over the logo with proper transparency

## Technical Goals
1. Accurate fluid dynamics simulation
2. Vibrant, changing colors in the fluid trail
3. Responsive to cursor velocity and direction
4. Efficient WebGL implementation for smooth performance
5. Proper layering of visual elements (logo behind fluid effect)
6. Future: Implement reflective interaction between logo and fluid

## Success Criteria
- Fluid effect renders smoothly at 60fps
- Effect works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Colors change dynamically as the cursor moves
- Fluid reacts realistically to cursor movements
