# Product Context: Fluid Simulation Cursor Effect

## Purpose
This fluid simulation cursor effect enhances user experience by providing an engaging, interactive visual element that responds to user input. It creates a sense of playfulness and responsiveness that makes the interface feel more alive and dynamic.

## User Experience Goals
1. Create a visually appealing effect that draws user attention
2. Provide immediate visual feedback to user interactions
3. Add a layer of polish and sophistication to the interface
4. Create a memorable, unique experience that differentiates the site

## Target Audience
- Website visitors looking for an engaging, interactive experience
- Users who appreciate visual design and creative interfaces
- Both desktop and mobile users

## Integration Context
This effect will be implemented as a background element that responds to cursor/touch movements without interfering with the main content or functionality of the site. It serves as an aesthetic enhancement rather than a core functional element.

## Brand Integration
The fluid simulation incorporates the maber.io logo as a central visual element:
- The colorful logo is displayed prominently in the center of the screen
- The fluid effect flows over and around the logo, creating a dynamic visual relationship
- This integration reinforces brand identity while maintaining the engaging interactive experience
- Future development will include a reflective effect between the logo and fluid for enhanced visual appeal
