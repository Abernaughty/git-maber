# Product Context

## Overview
This document explains why the PokeData project exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and the user experience goals.

## Why This Project Exists
The PokeData project exists to address a common challenge faced by Pokémon card collectors and enthusiasts: accessing reliable and comprehensive pricing information for Pokémon cards. The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) has thousands of cards across numerous sets, with prices that can vary significantly based on condition, edition, and market trends.

Collectors often need to check multiple sources to get accurate pricing information, which is time-consuming and can lead to inconsistent data. PokeData centralizes this process by aggregating pricing data from various sources into a single, easy-to-use interface, saving collectors time and helping them make more informed decisions about buying, selling, or trading cards.

Additionally, the project serves as a practical demonstration of modern web development techniques, including:
- Frontend development with Svelte
- API integration and data handling
- Offline caching strategies
- Responsive UI design
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Problems It Solves

1. **Fragmented Pricing Information**: Collectors typically need to check multiple websites to get comprehensive pricing data for a single card. PokeData consolidates pricing from various sources into one interface.

2. **Inefficient Search Process**: Finding specific cards across thousands of options can be cumbersome. PokeData streamlines this with a two-step search process (set selection followed by card selection) and searchable dropdowns.

3. **Inconsistent Data Presentation**: Different pricing sources present data in different formats. PokeData standardizes the presentation for easier comparison.

4. **Offline Access Limitations**: Many pricing tools require constant internet connectivity. PokeData implements caching for offline or limited-connectivity use.

5. **Zero-Value Results Confusion**: Some pricing sources return $0 or null values for cards they don't track. PokeData filters these out to avoid confusion.

6. **Variant Identification Challenges**: Cards often have multiple variants (holo, reverse holo, etc.) with different values. PokeData supports variant selection for more accurate pricing.

## How It Should Work

### User Flow
1. **Set Selection**: User selects a Pokémon card set from a searchable dropdown list.
2. **Card Selection**: After selecting a set, user chooses a specific card from that set using another searchable dropdown.
3. **Price Retrieval**: User clicks "Get Price" to fetch pricing data for the selected card.
4. **Results Display**: The application displays comprehensive pricing information from multiple sources, along with card details.
5. **Variant Selection** (when applicable): If a card has multiple variants, the user can select the specific variant to see its pricing.

### Technical Architecture
1. **Frontend**: 
   - Svelte-based single-page application
   - Component-based architecture for maintainability
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop use

2. **Data Management**:
   - API client for fetching data from pricing sources
   - Local storage/IndexedDB for caching
   - Fallback data for offline use

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Set list cached for extended periods
   - Card lists cached by set
   - Pricing data cached with shorter expiration
   - Fallback to local data when API is unavailable

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation when APIs fail
   - Clear error messages for users
   - Fallback to cached data when possible
   - Mock data for development and demonstration

## User Experience Goals

### For Casual Collectors
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use without technical knowledge
- **Speed**: Quick access to pricing information
- **Clarity**: Clear presentation of pricing data
- **Reliability**: Consistent and accurate information

### For Serious Collectors
- **Comprehensiveness**: Detailed pricing from multiple sources
- **Specificity**: Support for card variants and conditions
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined workflow for frequent price checks
- **Trustworthiness**: Transparent sourcing of pricing data

### For Trading Card Game Players
- **Relevance**: Focus on playable cards and current sets
- **Value Assessment**: Easy comparison of similar cards
- **Market Awareness**: Understanding of price trends
- **Decision Support**: Information to guide purchasing decisions

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Keep the interface clean and focused on the core task of price checking.
   - Minimize visual clutter
   - Clear, straightforward navigation
   - Prominent search and results areas

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Present the most important information first, with details available on demand.
   - Two-step search process (set then card)
   - Collapsible sections for additional details
   - Prioritize most relevant pricing information

3. **Responsive Performance**: Ensure the application works well across devices and network conditions.
   - Mobile-friendly design
   - Efficient loading and caching
   - Graceful handling of slow connections

4. **Informative Feedback**: Keep users informed about what's happening in the application.
   - Clear loading indicators
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Confirmation of successful actions

5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use design elements to guide users through the interface.
   - Prominent search controls
   - Distinct results section
   - Clear categorization of pricing data

## Current Implementation Status

The current implementation includes:

1. **Core Search Functionality**:
   - Searchable dropdown for set selection
   - Card name search within selected sets
   - Basic card variant support

2. **Pricing Display**:
   - Multiple pricing sources when available
   - Formatted price display with consistent decimal places
   - Filtering of zero-value pricing results

3. **Data Management**:
   - API integration with caching
   - Fallback to mock data when API fails
   - Local storage of set and card data

4. **User Interface**:
   - Clean, focused design
   - Basic responsive layout
   - Loading and error states

Recent improvements include:
- Converting the Card Name field to use the SearchableSelect component
- Filtering zero-value pricing results for clearer presentation
- Formatting price decimal places consistently

## Success Metrics

The success of the PokeData application will be measured by:

1. **Usability**: How easily users can find and retrieve pricing information
   - Time to complete a price check
   - Error rate during searches
   - User satisfaction with interface

2. **Reliability**: How consistently the application provides accurate data
   - API success rate
   - Cache hit rate
   - Accuracy of pricing information

3. **Performance**: How quickly the application responds to user actions
   - Initial load time
   - Search response time
   - Price retrieval speed

4. **Adoption**: How frequently users return to the application
   - Repeat usage statistics
   - User growth over time
   - Positive user feedback

## Future Enhancements
