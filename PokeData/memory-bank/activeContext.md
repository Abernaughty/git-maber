## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Caching Strategy**: Using IndexedDB through the dbService for efficient offline caching.
   - Pros: Better performance than localStorage, supports larger data sets
   - Cons: More complex implementation, browser compatibility considerations
   - Decision: Continue with IndexedDB but add better error handling and fallbacks

2. **API Client Structure**: Using a centralized service with proxy support.
   - Pros: Consistent error handling, centralized caching, easier debugging
   - Cons: Potential bottleneck, more complex than direct fetch calls
   - Decision: Maintain the centralized approach but optimize for performance

3. **Component Architecture**: Using Svelte components with clear separation of concerns.
   - Pros: Maintainable, reusable, efficient updates
   - Cons: Requires careful state management
   - Decision: Continue with component-based architecture, improve documentation

### Design Considerations
1. **UI/UX Approach**:
   - Focus on simplicity and efficiency
   - Progressive disclosure of information
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Consistent feedback for user actions

2. **Visual Design**:
   - Pokémon-themed color palette (blue, red, white)
   - Clean, card-based layout
   - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
   - Accessible contrast and typography

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Efficient API calls with caching
   - Lazy loading of images and data
   - Minimizing re-renders
   - Optimized search functionality

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Comprehensive error logging

3. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Support for modern browsers
   - Progressive enhancement
   - Feature detection
   - Fallbacks for older browsers

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
1. **File Structure**:
   - Components in src/components/
   - Services in src/services/
   - Data utilities in src/data/
   - Main application in App.svelte

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - PascalCase for component files (SearchableSelect.svelte)
   - camelCase for JavaScript files (pokeDataService.js)
   - camelCase for functions and variables
   - Descriptive, action-oriented function names

3. **Component Structure**:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/       # UI components
   │   ├── CardSearchSelect.svelte
   │   ├── CardVariantSelector.svelte
   │   ├── SearchableInput.svelte
   │   └── SearchableSelect.svelte
   ├── data/             # Static data and configuration
   │   ├── apiConfig.js
   │   ├── prismaticEvolutionsCards.js
   │   └── setList.js
   ├── services/         # Business logic and API services
   │   ├── pokeDataService.js
   │   └── storage/
   │       └── db.js
   ├── App.svelte        # Main application component
   ├── corsProxy.js      # CORS proxy utility
   ├── debug-env.js      # Debugging utilities
   └── main.js           # Application entry point
   ```

### Coding Patterns
1. **Service Pattern**:
   - Centralized services for data operations
   - Clear separation from UI components
   - Consistent error handling
   - Caching and optimization

2. **Component Composition**:
   - Small, focused components
   - Props for configuration
   - Events for communication
   - Slots for content projection

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Try/catch blocks for async operations
   - Fallback data when APIs fail
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Detailed console logging

4. **Caching Strategy**:
   - IndexedDB for persistent storage
   - Set-based caching for card data
   - TTL (Time To Live) for cache invalidation
   - Fallback to static data when cache fails

### Styling Approach
1. **CSS Organization**:
   - Component-scoped styles in Svelte
   - Global styles in public/global.css
   - Consistent color variables
   - Mobile-first responsive design

2. **Design Elements**:
   - Card-based UI components
   - Consistent spacing and typography
   - Pokémon-themed color palette
   - Clear visual hierarchy

## Learnings and Project Insights

We've gained several insights during the implementation:

1. **API Integration Challenges**: Working with external card pricing APIs presents challenges with inconsistent data formats, requiring robust parsing and normalization.

2. **Caching Complexity**: Effective caching requires careful consideration of cache invalidation, storage limits, and fallback mechanisms.

3. **Search UX Importance**: The two-step search process (set then card) significantly improves user experience compared to a single search field.

4. **Error Handling Significance**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and fallbacks is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience.

5. **Performance Considerations**: Large datasets of card information require optimization techniques like pagination, filtering, and efficient rendering.

6. **Component Reusability**: Investing in reusable components like SearchableSelect pays dividends across the application.

7. **Variant Handling Complexity**: Pokémon cards often have multiple variants with different pricing, requiring special handling in the UI and data model.

8. **Offline Support Value**: Users appreciate the ability to access previously viewed data when offline or when APIs are unavailable.

9. **Feedback Importance**: Clear loading states, error messages, and success indicators significantly improve user confidence in the application.

10. **Data Normalization Necessity**: Different API responses require normalization to provide a consistent user experience.
