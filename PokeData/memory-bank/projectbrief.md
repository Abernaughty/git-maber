# Project Brief

## Overview
This document defines the core requirements and goals for the PokeData project. It serves as the foundation document that shapes all other files in the Memory Bank.

## Project Name
PokeData: Pokémon Card Price Checker

## Project Description
PokeData is a web application designed to help Pokémon card collectors and enthusiasts quickly and easily look up pricing data for Pokémon cards based on set name and card name. The application provides detailed pricing information from various sources, supports multiple card variants, and implements offline caching for improved performance.

The project aims to create a user-friendly, responsive interface that allows users to search for cards by set and name, view comprehensive pricing data, and potentially track their collection in future updates. By centralizing pricing information from multiple sources, PokeData helps collectors make informed decisions about buying, selling, or trading Pokémon cards.
