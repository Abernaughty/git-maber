2. **Test Coverage**: Review and expand test coverage for critical components
3. **Accessibility Review**: Conduct WCAG 2.1 AA compliance assessment

### Medium-term (Next 2-4 Sessions)
1. **Component Enhancement**: Improve reusable component library
2. **Animation Integration**: Add subtle animations and transitions
3. **SEO Optimization**: Implement structured data and meta tag improvements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Memory Bank Pattern**: Implementing comprehensive documentation system for session continuity
- **Component Structure**: Maintaining atomic design principles with clear separation of concerns
- **State Management**: Using Svelte stores for complex state, local state for UI concerns
- **API Layer**: Mock data approach with future-ready real API integration patterns

### Design Decisions
- **Glass Morphism**: Continuing with current aesthetic for professional, modern appearance
- **Purple-Blue Gradient**: Maintaining consistent brand colors throughout experience
- **Responsive Strategy**: Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy and contrast

### Technical Decisions
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Maintaining type safety throughout codebase
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing with Vitest
- **Build Optimization**: Leveraging Vite and SvelteKit for optimal performance
- **Deployment**: Azure Static Web Apps for reliable, scalable hosting

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **File Structure**: Clear separation between components, stores, and utilities
- **Naming Conventions**: Descriptive, consistent naming across all files
- **Import Strategy**: Barrel exports for clean import statements
- **Type Definitions**: Centralized type definitions in dedicated files

### Component Patterns
- **Props Interface**: TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- **Event Handling**: Consistent event naming and handling patterns
- **Styling**: Scoped CSS with Tailwind utilities for rapid development
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML throughout

### State Management Patterns
- **Store Factories**: Custom store creation functions with typed interfaces
- **Async State**: Consistent loading/error/data pattern for async operations
- **Derived Stores**: Computed values based on primary store state
- **Store Composition**: Multiple stores working together for complex features

### Testing Patterns
- **Component Testing**: Testing Library approach with user-centric tests
- **Store Testing**: Direct store testing with mock data
- **Type Testing**: TypeScript compilation as part of test suite
- **Coverage Goals**: Maintaining high coverage for critical business logic

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Development Insights
- **SvelteKit Benefits**: Excellent developer experience with fast HMR and intuitive patterns
- **TypeScript Integration**: Seamless type safety without significant overhead
- **Tailwind Efficiency**: Rapid styling with consistent design system
- **Testing Approach**: Component-focused testing provides good confidence

### Performance Insights
- **Bundle Size**: SvelteKit's compile-time optimizations result in small bundles
- **Image Handling**: Dynamic path resolution needed for deployment flexibility
- **CSS Optimization**: Tailwind purging effectively reduces unused styles
- **Loading Strategy**: Async store loading provides good user experience

### User Experience Insights
- **Glass Morphism**: Creates professional, modern aesthetic that users respond well to
- **Gradient Usage**: Purple-blue gradient provides consistent brand identity
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch-friendly design with appropriate sizing
- **Content Hierarchy**: Clear information architecture guides user attention

### Technical Insights
- **Store Pattern**: Custom store factories provide excellent reusability
- **Component Composition**: Svelte's slot system enables flexible component design
- **API Layer**: Mock data approach allows development without backend dependency
- **Build Process**: Vite provides excellent development and production build experience

## Context for Future Sessions

### Key Files to Review
- **`src/routes/+page.svelte`**: Main portfolio page with all sections
- **`src/lib/stores/projects.ts`**: Project data management
- **`src/lib/api/projects.ts`**: Mock data and API patterns
- **`src/lib/components/ProjectCard.svelte`**: Reusable project display component

### Important Considerations
- **Path Resolution**: Dynamic path handling for different deployment contexts
- **Store Initialization**: Projects loaded on page mount with error handling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with careful breakpoint management
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage throughout codebase

### Development Environment
- **Local Server**: `npm run dev` on http://localhost:5173
- **Testing**: `npm run test` for unit tests, `npm run test:coverage` for coverage
- **Linting**: `npm run lint` for code quality checks
- **Building**: `npm run build` for production build

### Future Enhancement Areas
- **Real API Integration**: Replace mock data with actual backend API
